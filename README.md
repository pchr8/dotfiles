dotfiles
========

##Basics

This repository will contain some of my **dotfiles**, of which I have accumulated a lot. Both for easy management and for actual git practice on something more real than "this is a test file" or "this is an untracked file, shouldn't change".

##Currently, this repository contains:

* SpectrWM configs
* Mutt, offlineIMAP and msmtp
* Pentadactyl
* vim
* My startup.sh file
* And the mod4 file used for disabling Caps Lock and making a Ctrl out of it

More to come later.
