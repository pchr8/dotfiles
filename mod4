clear Lock
clear mod4
clear Control

keycode 66 = Control_L
keycode 37 = Hyper_L

add Control = Control_R Control_L
add mod4 = Super_L Super_R
add mod3 = Hyper_L



!   keycode 66 = Control_L
!   clear Lock
!   clear Control
!   keycode 37 = Hyper_L
!   add Control = Control_L
!   add mod4 = Super_L Super_R
!   !add mod3 = Hyper_L

! set F13 and others to F keys as is
! http://xahlee.info/linux/linux_xmodmap_tutorial.html
! keycode 192 = BackSpace
! keycode 192 = Hyper_L
keycode 192 = F13

! Now F14=Pedal points,  like Ctrl, to Hyper_L

! Let's try to map two keys to escape

! Right-alt
!keycode 108 = Escape

! This is used to then do
! bindsym uring exec xdotool click 1
! To click a mouse button with it. I seem to use this more often than I would expect
! 105 is right-ctrl

!keycode 134 = uring
